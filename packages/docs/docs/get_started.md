<p class="lead">
urx is a toolkit that lets JavaScript developers implement UI state management logic using the reactive programming paradigm.
urx ships a set of reactive utilities &ndash; streams, actions, transformers and operators. 
Streams and their relationships are then organized and partitioned in systems and subsystems. 
Next, the whole stream system is exposed as React component, exposing its streams as properties, methods, events, and hooks for child components.
